##################### INSTALLING #####################

Install required dependencies for your system first.
In Ubuntu and variants it should be fine if you
install package "python-qt4-dbus" from repositories.

In order to install pywapi-dbus, run:
python setup.py install
as root in source root directory (the directory that
has this README file).

The setup will byte-compile the pywapi-dbus and copy
it's files to right system directories for your system.
It will also install pywapi as Python module so it
can be used by other Python applications too.
