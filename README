D-Bus Python Weather API Service is intended to
provide weather information through D-Bus. It's
main goal is to provide same functionality as
Python Weather API provides as Python library.

D-Bus Python Weather API Service can be used
in all programming languages that has working D-Bus
libraries available.

######################################################

D-Bus Python Weather API Service depends on:
Python ( 3.0> version >2.5 )
Python Qt D-Bus library (python-qt-dbus)
D-Bus Python bindings
Python XML module
Python Urllib
Slightly modified Python Weather API (included!)

Although pywapi-dbus needs Python Qt D-Bus library,
it doesn't need all Qt libraries. Distributions
usually have a specific package for it (in Ubuntu
and variants, it's python-qt-dbus).

Feel free to port this to GLib, but unfortinately
it seems that if this is implemented with GLib
D-Bus Mainloop, the memory consumption is about
30-40% larger than with Qt D-Bus Mainloop.

Thanks to Eugene Kaznacheev for writing
the original pywapi library!

##################### INSTALLING #####################

Install required dependencies for your system first.
In Ubuntu and variants it should be fine if you
install package "python-qt4-dbus" from repositories.

In order to install pywapi-dbus, run:
python setup.py install
as root in source root directory (the directory that
has this README file).

The setup will byte-compile the pywapi-dbus and copy
it's files to right system directories for your system.
It will also install pywapi as Python module so it
can be used by other Python applications too.
